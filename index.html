		<h2> Who is Claire? </h2>
		<p>Claire lives in San Antonio, Texas, with her boyfriend and her cat, Nova. She recently moved to 
San Antonio for a career change. She has worked in retail for most of her working life but recently 
accepted a new position at a hospital call center.</p>
<p>She previously graduated from college with a Bachelor of Science degree in Consumer Science 
with a major in fashion merchandising and a minor in business admin. When she swapped careers, she 
had to learn a lot about computer systems and is proud of becoming much more computer literate. 
Using this newfound knowledge, she plans to attend school again for medical billing and coding to 
further her new career.</p>
<p>Recently, she has taken up a new goal of cooking and eating at home more often. She has signed 
up for an online meal delivery service and has found that receiving the ingredients for these meals helps 
a ton with her goal.</p>
<p>In her spare time, she loves to relax in the evening after work and either hang out with her 
boyfriend or watch shows on Netflix, sometimes at the same time! She has several hobbies, including 
crocheting, reading, and making an outfit for the Renaissance Festival. She wants to add going to the 
gym regularly as another hobby.</p>
<p>In the near future, Claire wants to further her career and an amount of debt she has accrued. 
Long term, Claire dreams of settling down, getting married, buying a house, and having kids. All while 
still maintaining her career working from home. </p>
